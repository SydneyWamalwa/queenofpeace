        <h2>Microcredit Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Microcredit opportunities where pastoral women learn how to save and grow their income.</p>

        <h2>Vocational Training and Career Mentorship</h2>
        <p>Vocational training and career mentorship for pastoral women to improve their skill set and for young girls striving to escape early marriages to be mentored on career advancement.</p>

        <h2>Socio-Economic and Environment Programme</h2>
        <p>For generations, pastoral women in northern Kenya have had limited access to resources due to a number of factors, including armed conflict, abject poverty, and traditions. They have also had to rely on the ecologically-devastating charcoal burning for income.</p>

        <h3>Our Socio-Economic and Environment Programme Aims to Tackle These Issues Through:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pursuit of socio-economic alternatives that protect our environment and positive culture.</li>
            <li>Pursuit of socio-economic alternatives that improve our health and nutrition, such as:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishment of kitchen gardens to improve nutrition and food security.</li>
                <li>Awareness creation of the effects of retrogressive cultural practices, such as early girls child marriages and female genital mutilation (FGM).</li>
                <li>Tree planting of indigenous trees and fruit trees.</li>
                <li>Exploring cooking alternatives, such as the use of energy-saving jikos.</li>
                <li>Exploring income-generating activities that promote and preserve positive culture, including our artifacts and music.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
